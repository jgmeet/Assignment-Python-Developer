# Table extraction

Run the solution.ipynb file to extract the table for the given image
The extracted table is saved in output_table.xlsx

## Requirements
Make sure to have following installed on your system
- [opencv](https://opencv.org/)
- [tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)
- [pytesseract](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/)

## Note
The code is fine-tuned to extract table from the image attached here only. The solution.ipynb contains a basic outline of code and still there's more work needed to get generalised results

Tesseract OMR is used here to extract text. This have it's own limitations and it might not awlays give accurate results.
